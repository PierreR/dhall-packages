= Openshift dhall configuration

== Introduction

This package introduce functions and types to make OpenShift configuration a
little bit less complicated.

These types represents the common patterns of our OpenShift usage.

== Naming conventions

We are using Camel Case for the different dhall types and functions.
Types always starts with an uppercase letter and are under a types directory.

== Basic Application

A basic application is one container exposed through one port, one service and
one route.

Next to that container we can create:
  - volumes
  - volumes claims
  - config maps
  - secrets

We define one new type for the configuration in
./basicApplication/types/Config.dhall and a helper function to create the
application based on that configuration in
./basicApplication/makeApplication.dhall
